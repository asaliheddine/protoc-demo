# A demo protoc plugin

An example plugin that alters Java code generated by the default protoc implementation.
VSCO uses a similar plugin to add capabilities to Java code generated for our Android application.

This demo adds some reflection features to a hypothetical telemetry system that sends protobufs over gRPC.

Build instructions

1.) Install Bazel http://www.bazel.io/docs/install.html. We use this build tool because that's what google/protobufs uses. Bazel requires Java.

2.) Build with ```bazel build main:protoc-gen-demo```

3.) A sample invocation of the plugin, protoc-gen-demo, is available in ```script/integration-test```. This script can be run from the command line.
